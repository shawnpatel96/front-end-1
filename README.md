On adding a new task site will need to be relogged for the task to appear, same with editing task. (will solve this with nested axioswithauth calls)

AddList component will sometimes throw a "code not found error".



☝️ Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
Wunderlist 2.0 takes your traditional to-do list app and automates it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip and household lists, but allows you to set up recurring to do lists by date and time. (Think recurring events on google calendar + to-do list app). No matter how much is on your plate, Wunderlist 2.0 makes it super easy to remember all the little recurring to-dos and surprise to-dos that pop up unexpectedly.
Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
Wunderlist aims to solve busy people’s lives by allowing a user to add a task, mark as complete, and delete a task. You can even add a task for the future via the calendar. The app will automatically show you the tasks you have for the day upon opening the app.
What is the mission statement?
Never have to “wonder” about your day, let WunderList do it for you.
